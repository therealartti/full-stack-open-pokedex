For this exercise I have chosen to work with Python, which offers a wide range of tools for the following continuous integration setup steps. For linting, “flake8” can be used to check for style guide enforcement, syntactic errors, and measuring code complexity. For testing, the built-in “unittest” can be used, but third party libraries such as “pytest” are preferred for their user-friendly syntax and wide range of plugins. Finally for building, we assume that the project needs to be packaged as a standalone .exe file. For this purpose, the use of “cx_Freeze” is considered an optimal solution.

Alternatives to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions can be CircleCI (which supports Python, integration with Github and a free tier). Another newer alternative would be Attune, which has gained a reputation thanks to their server automation tools and features.

To make the choice between self-hosted or a cloud-based environment, the team should first discuss the budget, security concerns and scale of the project. As the team consists of 6 people, maintaining a self-hosted setup would be the preferable hosting strategy in case they need more control over the security of sensitive data. At the end of the line, it all comes down to what kind of project they are working on.
